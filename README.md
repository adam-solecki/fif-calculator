# FIF Calculator

The FIF Calculator is a tool for New Zealand investors to calculate their Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) tax liability using the Fair Dividend Rate (FDR) method. In New Zealand, the FIF rules tax offshore investments at a deemed rate—commonly 5% of the market value—even if no dividends are received.

## Features

- **Fair Dividend Rate Method:** Calculates taxable income as 5% of the market value.
- **Dynamic Currency Conversion:** Retrieves real-time exchange rates so that investments denominated in various currencies are converted to NZD.
- **Portfolio-Level Calculation:** Allows you to input multiple offshore investments.
- **Marginal Tax Rate Input:** Enter your NZ marginal tax rate (as a percentage) to compute your actual tax liability.
- **User-Friendly CLI:** Simple command-line interface for quick calculations.

## Prerequisites
